## Welcome to Matic Lotto NFT Lottery Community ü§ù
Thanks for checking out our project

## Project Topic : An NFT Lottery System that fulfill the following user story
* A contract that issues NFTs to every player in each lottery round
* In every round, winners should be randomly picked by the contract. A moderator or an admin should be the one to call the function
* The winner of every round should be able to claim their prize within a given period of time after which the prize is nullified
* Contracts should not send the prize to the user rather the user should be able to claim the prize themselves
* The prize should be in ether
* Every user would pay for each round and a percentage of the total of each round would be the given to the winner.
* An interface to interact with the contract
